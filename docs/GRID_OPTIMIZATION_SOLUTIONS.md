# Grid Optimization Solutions

## Summary of High-Priority Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Microtype Protrusion (Already Complete)
- **Status**: Fully implemented in lines 2690-2829 of paperstyle.sty
- **Features**: Comprehensive character protrusion with size/weight/style variants
- **Note**: Audit report was incorrect; implementation is complete and working

### 2. ✅ Heading Grid Alignment
- **Issue**: Flexible spacing (±3.3pt) causes cumulative grid drift
- **Solution**: Created `paper/modules/headings-gridlocked.sty`
- **Key improvements**:
  - Reduced flexibility to ±1.65pt (0.125 units) for sections/subsections only
  - Fixed spacing for subsubsection/paragraph levels
  - Added `\gridsnap` recovery mechanism after sections
  - Three modes: strict (no flex), moderate (minimal flex), recovery (with snaps)

### 3. ✅ Mathematical Display Spacing
- **Issue**: Math displays allow ±3.3pt flexibility causing grid drift
- **Solution**: Created `paper/modules/mathematics-gridlocked.sty`
- **Key improvements**:
  - Reduced flexibility to ±0.825pt (0.0625 units)
  - Asymmetric spacing (positive bias) to maintain grid floor
  - Automatic grid recovery after all display environments
  - Fixed spacing for short displays and multi-line equations
  - Special `tallmath` environment for oversized content

## Implementation Guide

### To Use Grid-Locked Headings:
```latex
% Replace in paperstyle.sty or preamble:
\usepackage{paper/modules/headings-gridlocked}

% Choose mode:
\strictgridsections      % No flexibility
\moderategridsections    % Minimal flexibility (default)
\recoverygridsections    % With automatic recovery
```

### To Use Grid-Locked Mathematics:
```latex
% Add after loading paperstyle:
\usepackage{paper/modules/mathematics-gridlocked}

% Choose mode:
\strictmathdisplay       % No flexibility
\moderatemathdisplay     % Minimal flexibility (default)
\flexiblemathdisplay     % Original behavior
```

## Benefits

1. **Maintained Typography Quality**: Still prevents orphans/widows
2. **Improved Grid Adherence**: Maximum drift reduced from ±49.5pt to ±8.25pt
3. **Automatic Recovery**: Grid snaps prevent permanent misalignment
4. **Backward Compatible**: Can switch between modes as needed
5. **Professional Results**: Balances technical perfection with readability

## Next Steps

The high-priority grid issues are now resolved. The remaining medium-priority tasks include:
- Reducing paperstyle.sty size through better modularization
- Implementing remaining Hochuli refinements
- Resolving module circular dependencies
- Command namespace cleanup
