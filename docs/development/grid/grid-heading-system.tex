\section*{Heading Position Calculation System}

This document demonstrates a system for calculating heading positions to ensure they land on specific gridlines according to professional typography standards.

\subsection*{The Challenge}

Currently, our headings have correct spacing (multiples of 13.2pt) but don't necessarily land on specific gridlines. Professional standards require:
\begin{itemize}
\item Body text: aligns to every gridline
\item Subheads: land on 2nd gridlines (26.4pt intervals)
\item Headlines: hit 3rd or 4th gridlines (39.6pt or 52.8pt intervals)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Proposed Solution}

We need to implement a system that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Tracks cumulative vertical position
\item Calculates required adjustment to reach next appropriate gridline
\item Adds compensating space before headings
\item Ensures consistent "snap-to-grid" behavior
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Mathematical Approach}

For a heading at position $p$:
\begin{itemize}
\item Current position modulo grid: $r = p \bmod 13.2$
\item Target gridline: $n \times 13.2$ (where $n$ = 2 for subheads, 3-4 for headlines)
\item Required adjustment: $a = (n \times 13.2) - r$
\end{itemize}

\section{Test Section}
This section should land on a 3rd or 4th gridline.

\subsection{Test Subsection}
This subsection should land on a 2nd gridline.

Text continues here to show how body text aligns to the grid. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

\subsubsection{Test Subsubsection}
This should also align appropriately.

More body text follows. The grid overlay shows whether our headings are landing on the correct gridlines. Notice how body text naturally aligns to every gridline when properly spaced.

\paragraph{Test Paragraph}
Paragraph headings have their own alignment requirements.

Final body text to demonstrate continued grid alignment throughout the document.
