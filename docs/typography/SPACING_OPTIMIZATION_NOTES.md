# Spacing Optimization Notes - July 2, 2025

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Title Page Footnote Spacing

**Problem:** Footnote line spacing on title page was too wide, creating unprofessional appearance.

**Solution:**
- Changed footnote leading from `\fontsize{9}{13.2}` to `\fontsize{9}{11}` (9pt/11pt)
- Reduced `\footnotesep` from 2.2pt to 1.1pt
- Reduced `\skip\footins` from 13.2pt to 9.9pt

**Location:** paperstyle.sty lines 1747-1771

### 2. Section Spacing Reduction

**Problem:** Excessive space above sections and below preceding content looked peculiar to conservative scientists.

**Solution:**
```latex
% SECTION spacing changes:
\titlespacing*{\section}
  {0pt}
  {26.4pt plus 3.3pt minus 3.3pt}  % Was: 39.6pt (reduced from 3 to 2 units)
  {13.2pt plus 1.65pt minus 0pt}    % Was: 13.2pt plus 3.3pt

% SUBSECTION spacing changes:
\titlespacing*{\subsection}
  {0pt}
  {19.8pt plus 3.3pt minus 1.65pt}  % Was: 26.4pt (reduced from 2 to 1.5 units)
  {9.9pt plus 1.65pt minus 0pt}      % Was: 13.2pt plus 3.3pt
```

**Location:** paperstyle.sty lines 1957-1973

### 3. Float/Table Spacing

**Problem:** Tables appeared at bottom of page with excessive space between table and text.

**Solution:**
```latex
% Previous values -> New values
\setlength{\floatsep}{13.2pt plus 3.3pt minus 3.3pt}        % Was: 19.8pt
\setlength{\textfloatsep}{13.2pt plus 3.3pt minus 3.3pt}    % Was: 26.4pt (50% reduction)
\setlength{\intextsep}{9.9pt plus 1.65pt minus 0pt}         % Was: 13.2pt
\setlength{\dblfloatsep}{13.2pt plus 3.3pt minus 3.3pt}     % Was: 19.8pt
\setlength{\dbltextfloatsep}{13.2pt plus 3.3pt minus 3.3pt} % Was: 26.4pt
```

**Location:** paperstyle.sty lines 1435-1439

## Impact

- Document now 30 pages (was 32) - more efficient space usage
- Maintains baseline grid system (13.2pt)
- More conservative, scientific appearance
- Title page footnotes now professionally tight
- Section transitions less dramatic
- Tables sit closer to related text

## Baseline Grid Compliance

All changes maintain grid alignment:
- 26.4pt = 2 grid units
- 19.8pt = 1.5 grid units  
- 13.2pt = 1 grid unit
- 9.9pt = 0.75 grid units
- 6.6pt = 0.5 grid units
- 3.3pt = 0.25 grid units
- 1.65pt = 0.125 grid units
- 1.1pt = 0.083 grid units
