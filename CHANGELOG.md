# Changelog

All notable changes to the Lane LaTeX Template are documented here.

## 2026-05-28

- Clarified the canonical bibliography loading contract and documented the manual `nobiblatex` override path.
- Added regression coverage for manually loaded biblatex with `lltpaperstyle[nobiblatex]`.
- Fixed the bibliography test harness package search path for direct fixture runs.
- Documented the Poppler `pdftotext` dependency used by PDF text regression assertions.
- Made the compatibility regression test skip PDF text assertions clearly when `pdftotext` is unavailable.

## 2026-05-27

- Restored optional footnote mark support and appendix section compatibility for starred and short-title forms.
- Added a focused regression fixture for footnote and appendix compatibility backports.
- Restored the repository infrastructure contract so the AGENTS.md lint, build, and regression gates are runnable from the root.
- Resolved the active merge marker in `main.tex` without changing the intended LaTeX layout.
- Updated active build and test references from the removed package name to `lltpaperstyle`.
- Added pytest coverage for build-target drift, executable shell harnesses, root changelog presence, active package references, and the minimal LaTeX regression harness.
