# Academic Paper Quality Checklist

**Pre-Submission Verification for Professional Academic Documents**

Use this comprehensive checklist to ensure your academic paper meets the highest standards for professional publication.

## ✅ Typography and Formatting Quality

### Title and Caption Standards
- [ ] All titles use headline-style capitalization (verified with title case checker)
- [ ] Section and subsection headings follow capitalization rules
- [ ] Figure captions placed below figures with proper capitalization
- [ ] Table captions placed above tables with proper capitalization
- [ ] Hyphenated words capitalized correctly (e.g., "Learning-Based Approach")
- [ ] Special cases handled correctly (e.g., "X-ray" not "X-Ray")

### Typography Standards
- [ ] All emphasis uses semantic commands (`\emph{}`, not `\textit{}`)
- [ ] Small caps use provided commands (`\bsc{}`, `\headsc{}`, `\balancedbsc{}`)
- [ ] Mathematical notation uses semantic commands (`\real`, `\norm{}`, `\abs{}`)
- [ ] Code typography uses appropriate commands for context
- [ ] Colors use semantic commands, not manual `\textcolor{}`

### Professional Cross-Referencing
- [ ] All labels use systematic prefixes (`tbl:`, `fig:`, `sec:`, `subsec:`, `alg:`, `app:`)
- [ ] Labels are descriptive, not generic (`fig:system-architecture`, not `fig1`)
- [ ] Non-breaking spaces used before all citations (`~\cite{}`)
- [ ] Non-breaking spaces used before all references (`Figure~\ref{}`, `Table~\ref{}`)
- [ ] "Figure" and "Table" capitalized in cross-references
- [ ] Enhanced cross-referencing used when appropriate (`\cref{}`, `\Cref{}`)

## ✅ Reproducibility and Research Integrity

### Technical Documentation
- [ ] Complete software version documentation provided
- [ ] Programming languages and library versions specified
- [ ] Random seeds documented for reproducible results
- [ ] Computational environment described (hardware, OS)
- [ ] Code availability statement included
- [ ] Data availability and access procedures documented

### Experimental Design Clarity
- [ ] Dataset splits clearly described (train/validation/test)
- [ ] Sampling methods documented (stratified, random, etc.)
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning procedures explained
- [ ] Cross-validation strategies detailed
- [ ] Baseline comparisons appropriately chosen
- [ ] Evaluation metrics justified for the task

### Citation and Reference Quality
- [ ] Appropriate citation density throughout document
- [ ] Citations integrated with contextual analysis
- [ ] Primary sources cited for original claims
- [ ] Recent and relevant literature included

- [ ] Bibliography appears and formats correctly
- [ ] Mathematical expressions render properly
- [ ] Figures and tables appear in correct positions

### Final Document Quality
- [ ] PDF meets accessibility standards
- [ ] Professional typography throughout
- [ ] Consistent spacing and alignment
- [ ] No orphaned headings or awkward page breaks
- [ ] Professional color scheme maintained
- [ ] Links and bookmarks function correctly

## ✅ Publication Readiness

### Content Completeness
- [ ] Abstract accurately summarizes contributions
- [ ] Introduction clearly motivates the problem
- [ ] Related work demonstrates field knowledge
- [ ] Methodology enables reproduction
- [ ] Results directly address research questions
- [ ] Discussion interprets findings appropriately
- [ ] Conclusion summarizes contributions and future work

### Professional Presentation

## Final Verification Steps

1. **Complete Compilation Test**:
   ```bash
   rm *.aux *.bbl *.bcf *.blg *.log *.out *.toc *.run.xml
   pdflatex main.tex && biber main && pdflatex main.tex && pdflatex main.tex
   ```

2. **Cross-Reference Verification**: Check all `\ref{}`, `\cite{}`, and `\cref{}` commands resolve correctly

3. **Typography Review**: Verify consistent formatting, proper emphasis, and professional appearance

4. **Academic Standards Check**: Confirm citation quality, statistical reporting, and reproducibility documentation

5. **Accessibility Verification**: Test PDF with screen readers and color-blind simulation tools
