\section{Enhanced Optical Margin Alignment Test}

This document demonstrates the enhanced optical margin alignment (v2.1) with comprehensive character protrusion settings.

\subsection{Regular Text Protrusion}

"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." This sentence demonstrates quote protrusion at 1400 units---a 40\% increase from standard settings. Notice how the opening quote hangs into the margin, creating a cleaner text edge.

\subsection{Capital Letter Overhang}

Typography requires careful attention to detail. Vast improvements come from subtle adjustments. When capitals like T, V, W, and Y appear at line beginnings, they use negative protrusion to compensate for their natural overhang.

\subsection{Bold Text Compensation}

\textbf{Bold text requires different protrusion values. "Quotes" in bold use 1200 units instead of 1400.}

\subsection{Small Text Optimization}

\footnotesize
In footnotes and captions, "protrusion values are reduced to maintain readability."
