\section{Footnote Typography Optimization Test}

This paragraph demonstrates the new optimized footnote system following professional foundry standards.\footnote{This first footnote uses 8.5pt text with 11pt leading, creating perfect grid alignment. The superscript is now 6pt with enhanced tracking for clarity.} The footnotes should integrate seamlessly with the baseline grid while maintaining clear subordination to the body text.

Multiple footnotes on the same reference\footnote{Second footnote demonstrating the 3.3pt (0.25 grid units) spacing between notes.}\footnote{Third footnote showing how consecutive marks are handled with proper kerning.} show the refined spacing system. Notice how the footnote rule extends to 33\% of the text measure, positioned exactly 2 grid units below the main text baseline.

\subsection{Punctuation Integration}

The system handles punctuation gracefully. Here's a sentence ending with a period.\footnote{Footnote after period with optimized kerning.} And here's one with a comma,\footnote{Footnote after comma showing tighter spacing.} demonstrating professional typography.

\paragraph{Grid Recovery} After the footnote block, the main text should return perfectly to the baseline grid. The 8.5pt footnote text with 11pt leading aligns to 0.833 gridlines (11pt รท 13.2pt), allowing smooth recovery of the main text rhythm.

This final paragraph\footnote{A longer footnote to test hyphenation and justification. The hanging indent is now 7pt (0.53 grid units), creating optimal proportion with Pagella's generous x-height. Word spacing is optimized at 0.35em for readability at this smaller size.} confirms that the grid is maintained throughout the document.
