# Repository Cleanup Summary

Date: July 9, 2025

## Files Moved to Archive

### CTAN Review Documents (archive/ctan-review/)
- CTAN_CODE_REVIEW.md
- CTAN_TECHNICAL_REVIEW.md
- CTAN_FIXES_IMPLEMENTED.md

### Implementation Logs (archive/implementation-logs/)
- MODULE_RENAMING_COMPLETE.md
- PACKAGE_RENAMING_COMPLETE.md
- DOCUMENTATION_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md

- MAKEFILE_FIXES.md

### Old Plans and Superseded Documents (archive/old-plans/)
- PACKAGE_RENAMING_PLAN.md
- GEMINI.md (superseded by CLAUDE.md)

## Files Removed
- preamble-natbib.tex (duplicate of paper/preamble-natbib.tex)
- LaTeX auxiliary files (.aux, .log, .out, .bbl, .blg)

## Files Relocated
- minimal.tex → tests/fixtures/minimal-root.tex

## Style File Comments
The main style file (paper/lltpaperstyle.sty) contains approximately 1254 lines of comments out of 3280 total lines (38%). Many of these are:
- Proper documentation comments (should remain)
- Removed command definitions marked as "REMOVED: ... (2025-07-06 cleanup)"
- Historical notes and references

## Recommendations for Further Cleanup

1. **Style File**: Consider removing the commented-out command definitions that are marked as "REMOVED" to reduce file size
2. **Test Fixtures**: Some test files in tests/fixtures/ could be consolidated
3. **Documentation**: Consider consolidating some of the overlapping documentation files

## Archive Structure Created
```

All archived files remain accessible for historical reference but are now out of the main working directory.
